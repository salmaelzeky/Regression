# Instructions on how to access and work on your assignment

## Accessing and committing to your assignment repo via Google Colab

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/github
2. Click the "Include Private Repos" checkbox
3. In the popup window, sign-in to your GitHub account and authorize Colab to read the private repos
4. Your private repositories and notebooks will now be available; select your mini-project repository and click on the Mini-Project notebook to start working on it
5. To save your notebook progress, click on "File" in the toolbar, and select "Save a copy in GitHub". You may then edit the commit message if desired and click on "Ok".

## Accessing and committing to your assignment repo via local Jupyter installation

Familiarity with `git` is assumed. If you're unfamiliar with `git`, it'd be best to brush up on basic `git` concepts using online tutorials as it is a core part of any data science workflow that uses Python/R. Recommended starters: [Roger Dudler's simple guide to git](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/); [GitHub's Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/); [GitHub's git cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).

1. Git clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_REPO}.git`
2. Make sure you have the necessary python packages installed (or a recent anaconda distribution) installed. If using anaconda, you may want to invoke `conda upgrade --all` in the command line to make sure all your packages are up-to-date
3. Launch Jupyter notebook and navigate to where you cloned the repo; you may then work on the notebook and save it as you're working on it
4. You may then commit changes as they are ready by `git commit -am "YOUR_COMMIT_MSG"`, and then pushing to your assignment repo using `git push`

## Additional Notes/Clarifications

- You may commit and push to your assignment repo as many times as you'd like as only the final state of your repo will be counted as your submission
- If you're done working on the mini-project and pushed/saved your changes to it, no further input or submission procedure is required of you
- Your repository will be automatically locked when the assignment's due date passes, so please keep that in mind when working late close to the assignment's deadline
